            Weak probabilistic noninterference is a security property for enforcing confidentiality in multi-threaded programs. 
            It aims to guarantee secure flow of information in the program and ensure that sensitive information does not leak 
            to attackers. In this paper, the problem of verifying weak probabilistic noninterference by leveraging formal methods, 
            in particular algorithmic verification, is discussed. Behavior of multi-threaded programs is modeled using probabilistic 
            Kripke structures and formalize weak probabilistic noninterference in terms of 
           }

  abstract = {This paper proposes an approach to verify information flow security of concurrent programs. It discusses a hyperproperty 
         called observational determinism which aims to ensure secure information flow in concurrent programs, and proves how this 
         hyperproperty can be verified by stutter equivalence checking. More precisely, it defines observational determinism in 
         terms of stutter equivalence of all traces having the same low initial value and shows how stutter trace equivalence can 
         be verified by computing a divergence stutter bisimulation quotient. The approach is illustrated by verifying a small example.}
