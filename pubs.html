 An automated quantitative information flow analysis for concurrent

              Quantitative information flow is a rigorous approach for evaluating the security of a system. It is used to quantify 
              the amount of secret information leaked to the public outputs. In this paper, we propose an automated approach for 
              quantitative information flow analysis of concurrent programs. Markovian processes are used to model the behavior of these programs. 
              To this end, we assume that the attacker is capable of observing the internal behavior of the program and propose 
              an equivalence relation, back-bisimulation, to capture the attacker's view of the program behavior. A partition refinement algorithm 
              is developed to construct the back-bisimulation quotient of the program model and then a quantification method is proposed for 
              computing the information leakage using the quotient. Finally, an anonymous protocol, dining cryptographers, is analyzed as 
              a case study to show applicability and scalability of the proposed approach.

 Quantifying information leakage of probabilistic programs using the

              Information leakage is the flow of information from secret inputs of a program to its public outputs. One effective approach 
              to identify information leakage and potentially preserve the confidentiality of a program is to quantify the flow of information 
              that is associated with the execution of that program, and check whether this value meets predefined thresholds. 
              For example, the program may be considered insecure, if this quantified value is higher than the threshold. 
              In this paper, an automated method is proposed to compute the information leakage of probabilistic programs. 
              We use Markov chains to model these programs, and reduce the problem of measuring the information leakage to the problem of
              computing the joint probabilities of secrets and public outputs. The proposed method traverses the Markov chain 
              to find the secret inputs and the public outputs and subsequently, calculate the joint probabilities. 
              The method has been implemented into a tool called PRISM-Leak, which uses the PRISM model checker to build 
              the Markov chain of input programs. The applicability of the proposed method is highlighted by analyzing 
              a probabilistic protocol and quantifying its leakage.

              Quantitative information flow is an important technique for measuring information leakage of a program. It is widely used
              in analyzing anonymity protocols and timing channels. One area of interest is to quantify the information leakage of
              multi-threaded programs, which has not been well-studied in prior work. In this paper, an automated trace-based approach is
              proposed to precisely quantify information leakage of shared-memory multi-threaded programs. The approach takes into account
              the effect of schedulers and leakage in intermediate states of executions. The programs are modeled by Markovian processes.
              Then, variants of information leakage, including expected, bounded time, maximum, and minimum leakages are measured. 
              The validity of the approach is demonstrated by implementing it in a tool PRISM-Leak, which is built upon PRISM, 
              a probabilistic model checker. Finally, two case studies are utilized to analyze and compare the approach against

 Bisimulation for secure information flow analysis of multi-threaded

              Preserving the confidentiality of information is a growing concern in software development. Secure information flow 
              is intended to maintain the confidentiality of sensitive information by preventing them from flowing to attackers. 
              This paper discusses how to ensure confidentiality for multi-threaded programs through a property called 
              observational determinism. Operational semantics of multi-threaded programs are modeled using Kripke structures. 
              Observational determinism is formalized in terms of divergence weak low-bisimulation. Bisimulation is an equivalence 
              relation associating executions that simulate each other. The new property is called 
              bisimulation-based observational determinism. Furthermore, a model checking method is proposed to verify the new property 
              and ensure that secure information flow holds in a multi-threaded program. The model checking method successively 
              refines the Kripke model of the program until the quotient of the model with respect to divergence weak low-bisimulation 
              is reached. Then, bisimulation-based observational determinism is checked on the quotient, which is a minimized model of 
              the concrete Kripke model. The time complexity of the proposed method is polynomial in the size of the Kripke model. 
              The proposed approach has been implemented on top of PRISM, a probabilistic model checking tool. Finally, 
              a case study is discussed to show the applicability of the proposed approach.

            Weak probabilistic noninterference is a security property for enforcing confidentiality in multi-threaded programs. 
            It aims to guarantee secure flow of information in the program and ensure that sensitive information does not leak 
            to attackers. In this paper, the problem of verifying weak probabilistic noninterference by leveraging formal methods, 
            in particular algorithmic verification, is discussed. Behavior of multi-threaded programs is modeled using probabilistic 
            Kripke structures and formalize weak probabilistic noninterference in terms of these structures. Then, a verification 
            algorithm is proposed to check weak probabilistic noninterference. The algorithm uses an abstraction technique to compute 
            quotient space of the program with respect to an equivalence relation called weak probabilistic bisimulation and does 
            a simple check to decide whether the security property is satisfied or not. The progress made is demonstrated by a 
            real-world case study. It is expected that the proposed approach constitutes a significant step towards more widely 
            applicable secure information flow analysis.
